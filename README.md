# Task 5
# Personal-Loan-Acceptance-Prediction-
Predicting which bank customers are likely to accept personal loan offers using the Bank Marketing Dataset. Includes data exploration, visualization, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree modeling, and actionable insights to guide targeted marketing campaigns.
# Task Objective
# The objective of this task is to build a classification model that predicts
# whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer, based on their
# demographic and profile information. We also aim to extract meaningful
# business insights from the model results and exploratory analysis.

#  Approach
# 1. Load the Bank Marketing Dataset using pandas.
# 2. Perform basic data exploration on features such as age, job, and marital status,
#    using summary statistics and visualizations.
# 3. Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and handling any missing values.
# 4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# 5. Train a classification model such as Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.
# 6. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall).
# 7. Analyze the model results to see which customer groups show higher acceptance rates.

# Results and Insights
# The trained model provides predictions of which customers are likely to accept
# a personal loan offer. From the analysis, we can observe patterns such as
# certain age groups, job categories, or marital statuses having higher
# acceptance probabilities. These insights help the bank focus its marketing
# efforts on customer segments with a greater likelihood of responding positively
# to personal loan campaigns.
